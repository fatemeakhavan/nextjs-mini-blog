## Rendering and Caching Choices

I used **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** to fetch data dynamically from the API.  
Data fetching and caching are handled with **React Query** and custom hooks, which manage loading, error states, and background refetching.

If I had more time, I would focus on improving the UI/UX.
This includes creating a more polished design, enhancing responsiveness across devices, and improving accessibility to provide a smoother and more user-friendly experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run the project

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run Next.js + JSON Server together
npm run dev:all
